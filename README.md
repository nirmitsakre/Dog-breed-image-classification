# Dog-breed-image-classification

End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

2. Data

The data we are using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

3. Evaluation

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilites for each dog breed of each test image

4. Features

Some information about the data:

We are dealing with images (unstrucutred data) so it is probably best we use deep learining/ transfer learning.
There are 120 breeds of dogs ( this means there are 120 different classes) *
